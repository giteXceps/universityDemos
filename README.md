**University Lab Course Demos**

This repository includes a collection of projects and demos I developed during my university lab courses. Each demo was created as part of hands-on assignments, aimed at reinforcing theoretical concepts through practical application. The projects cover various topics and programming techniques, offering a glimpse into my learning journey in the field of Computer Engineering.

Feel free to explore the code, review the implementations, and experiment with the projects!
